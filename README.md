### How It Works

- Go to the app's home page at https://eatdatastyburger.herokuapp.com/
- Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
- When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
- Every burger will be saved in the database whether devoured or not.
